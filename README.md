## [0x01] Abstract

Sentinel represents a paradigm shift from user-space tracing (`ptrace`) to kernel-space filtering. Unlike legacy HIDS that suffer from significant overhead, Sentinel achieves native speed for 99% of operations by intercepting only critical control plane events (`execve`, `openat`, `connect`) while offloading deep analysis to a Userspace Supervisor.

The current architecture introduces Architectural Hardening against modern Linux threats, specifically targeting "Ghost" I/O and kernel-resident malware.

> [!NOTE]
> Read the [MITRE Mapping](docs/MITRE_MAPPING.md) for a technical deep-dive into how Sentinel aligns with the ATT&CK framework.

-----

## [0x02] Architectural Pivot: Seccomp vs Ptrace

In earlier iterations (v3.x), Sentinel employed a `ptrace` loop that paused every system call. In Milestone 4.0, we architecturally pivoted to Seccomp User Notifications (`SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF`).

|Feature        |Legacy M3 (Ptrace)            |Modern M4 (Seccomp)            |
|---------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Interception   |All Syscalls (Global Pause)   |Filtered (Only Critical Events)|
|Overhead       |~54x (Heavy Context Switching)|~1.12x (Near Native Speed)     |
|Throughput     |~28,000 OPS                   |~1,366,558 OPS                 |
|Race Conditions|Vulnerable to TOCTOU          |Atomic Mitigation (ADDFD)      |
|Blind Spots    |`io_uring`, eBPF loading      |Hard Blocked / Trapped         |

**Conclusion:** For production runtime enforcement, Seccomp provides the necessary performance characteristics while maintaining the ability to inspect critical security boundaries.

-----

## [0x03] Critical Defense Capabilities (M4)

### 1. The "Ghost Tunnel" Block (Anti-Evasion)

- **Threat:** Malware using `io_uring` to bypass standard syscall auditing (e.g., "Curing" Rootkit).
- **Defense:** Sentinel M4 enforces a Hard Block on `io_uring_setup` and `io_uring_enter` at the BPF level.
- **Verdict:** `EPERM` returned instantly. Zero chance of evasion.

### 2. The Invisible Enemy Trap (Kernel Integrity)

- **Threat:** Loading malicious eBPF bytecode to blind security tools (e.g., BPFDoor).
- **Defense:** Traps the `bpf()` syscall. The Supervisor analyzes the load attempt and blocks unauthorized programs before they execute.

### 3. Atomic Injection (Anti-TOCTOU)

- **Threat:** `runc` container escapes (CVE-2025-31133) utilizing Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use race conditions.
- **Defense:** Sentinel uses `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_ADDFD`. The Supervisor opens and verifies the file on behalf of the victim, then injects the safe File Descriptor. The victim never handles the path, making path-swapping attacks impossible.

-----

## [0x04] Performance Benchmarks (Validated)

We benchmarked Sentinel M4 against the previous M3 (Ptrace) architecture and a Native Baseline.

|Metric                |Native Linux (Baseline)|Sentinel M4 (Seccomp)|M3 Legacy (Ptrace)|
|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
|Throughput (Fast Path)|1,556,510 OPS          |1,366,558 OPS        |~28,000 OPS       |
|Overhead Impact       |0%                     |~12%                 |~5400%            |
|Inspection Cost       |0.130s                 |2.313s               |>10.0s            |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sentinel M4 retains ~88% of native throughput for compute-heavy workloads. The 2.3s latency on I/O-heavy tasks (Macro-Benchmark) reflects the cost of Deep Semantic Inspection on every file access. This is a deliberate trade-off for zero-false-positive security.

-----

## [0x05] Usage (M4.0)

### 1. Build The Engine

```bash
# Requires libseccomp-dev
make clean && make
```

### 2. Start The Defense Grid

You must run the Brain (Logic) and the Body (Interceptor) together.

**Terminal 1: The Brain**

```bash
python3 src/analysis/brain.py
```

**Terminal 2: The Body (Interceptor)**

```bash
# Protect a shell (and all its children)
sudo ./bin/sentinel /bin/bash
```

-----

## [0x06] Technical Specifications (M4.0)

### The "Auto-DLP" Bridge

Sentinel M4 retains the bridge between userspace and kernelspace.

1. **Trigger:** User opens `top_secret.pdf`.
1. **Analysis:** Brain tags file as `SENSITIVE_USER_FILE`.
1. **Action:** Brain writes the filename to `signatures.txt`.
1. **Enforcement:** Hyperion XDP (Network Firewall) reads the signature and instantly drops any outgoing packet containing that filename.

## [0x07] Roadmap: The Evolution to M8 (eBPF)

Sentinel is currently transitioning from Phase 2 (Seccomp/M4) to Phase 3 (eBPF-LSM/M8) to address advanced evasion techniques used by targeted threat actors.

### M5: "Project Ocular" (Observability Gap)

- **Problem:** Seccomp could block calls, but couldn't see data (e.g., it sees `openat` but not the filename if the pointer is complex).
- **Solution:** Introduced eBPF `fentry` hooks for deep argument inspection.
- **Status:** `COMPLETED` -- Replaced Python ptrace logger with C-based BPF ring buffers.

### M6: "The Iron Gate" (LSM Migration)

- **Problem:** Seccomp is vulnerable to Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) races in complex container environments.
- **Solution:** Migrated enforcement from syscall-entry (Seccomp) to LSM Hooks (`security_bprm_check`, `security_file_open`).
- **Impact:** Enforcement now happens after the kernel resolves paths, eliminating race conditions.
- **Status:** `COMPLETED` -- Core Engine Ported.

### M7: "The Bloodline" (Inheritance Tracking)

- **Problem:** The "Fork Loophole." A malicious process could `fork()` rapidly, and the child would execute before the userspace supervisor could attach.
- **Solution:** Implemented Kernel-Space Lineage Tracking.
  - Used `BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH` to store parent-child relationships.
  - Enforced policy inheritance atomically at `task_alloc`.
- **Status:** `COMPLETED` -- This is the "Fork-Evasion" fix.

### M8: "Citadel" (Current Release Candidate)

- **Focus:** Fileless Malware & Memory Defense.
- **Features:**
  - **Anti-Memfd:** Hooks `memfd_create` to detect fileless ELF loading (TeamTNT tactic).
  - **Ghost-Buster:** Detects `LD_PRELOAD` injection attempts.
  - **Optimization:** Code path optimized to `<5us` latency.
- **Status:** `ACTIVE RESEARCH`

> [!WARNING]
> M8 is under active development. The eBPF-LSM engine (`src/lsm/`) is functional but the API surface may change between milestones.
